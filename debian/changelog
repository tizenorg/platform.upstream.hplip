  * debian/patches/workaround-sf-server-bug-for-plugin-index-download.dpatch:
    In order to download the proprietary plug-in (firmware files, driver
    add-ons), the "hp-plugin" utility downloads an index file from SourceForge.
    Due to software changes at SourceForge which introduced a bug, Python's
    urllib is not able any more to download this file, making the plug-in
    download via "hp-plugin" impossible. HP has quickly released HPLIP 3.11.3a
    which works around the problem by using the command line utility "wget".
    This patch is a backport of the workaround (LP: #740140).

    download now.

  * debian/control: libsane-hpaio actually works without hplip, it only needs
    a few selected files from hplip. What was still missing was
    /etc/hp/hplip.conf. So moved over /etc/hp/hplip.conf to libsane-hpaio,
    made libsane-hpaio only recommending hplip and hplip depending on
    libsane-hpaio again, as hplip also does not work without /etc/hp/hplip.conf.
    This configuration allows minumum setups for HP MF device support without
    hplip, only using one of hpijs and hpcups for the printer and libsane-hpaio
    for the scanner (Closes: #596467).

  * debian/local/pyppd/, debian/rules: Compressed all the physical PPD files
    for the PostScript printers of the hplip-data package into an archiv file
    reducing the disk space occupation by a factor of 10, freeing several tens
    of megabytes on the Ubuntu Desktop CDs (or on any live CD based on Debian
    or a derivative distribution). The archives are self-extracting and located
    in /usr/lib/cups/driver/, so that CUPS automatically extracts the PPD
    files. Thank you very much to Vitor Baptista who developed this great PPD
    compressor in the Google Summer of Code 2010 (LP: #493282).
  * debian/hplip.postinst: Updated auto updater for the PPDs of the already

hplip (3.9.10-0ubuntu1) lucid; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     o hpcups driver rewritten: Simpler code, no bi-directional access needed
       any more, especially not for 4-edge borderless printing, therefore
       faster, print modes, paper sizes, mechanical offsets, and margins are
       controlled by the PPD now, so easier debugging in cooperation with the
       user.
     o Added support for: HP Photosmart All-in-one Printer b109 Series,
       including Wireless, HP Photosmart Premium All-in-one Printer c309
       Series, including Fax, HP Photosmart a640 Printer Series, HP Deskjet
       f24xx All-in-one Printer Series, HP Deskjet f4500 All-in-one Printer
       Series
  * debian/patches/hp_photosmart_pro_b9100_support.dpatch,
    debian/patches/85_rebuild_python_ui.dpatch: Regenerated for new upstream
    version, especially let 85_rebuild_python_ui.dpatch make "pyuic4" being

  * debian/patches/hplip-polkit-1-migration.dpatch,
    debian/patches/hpcups-drv-page-sizes-order.dpatch: Removed, fixed upstream.
  * debian/control: Replaced old Qt3-based build dependency on "pyqt-tools"
    by the new Qt4-based "pyqt4-dev-tools".
  * debian/control: Made "hplip-gui" requiring "hplip-cups" as hp-setup can
    only create fax queues with the hpcups driver (LP: #459275).
  * debian/hplip-cups.postinst, debian/hpijs.postinst: Let queues using
    the HPIJS driver be automatically migrated to using the hpcups driver as
    the regressions of hpcups should be fixed now.

  * debian/hplip-cups.postinst, debian/hpijs.postinst: Let the hpijs package
    migrate queues for the hpcups driver (hplip-cups package) to the HPIJS
    driver when updating PPDs of existing queues. The hplip-cups package
    does not migrate HPIJS queues any more now. We prefer HPIJS for now as
    hpcups has still problems, especially shifted prints on the back side
    of the sheet (LP: #426826), page size confusion with duplex printing
    (LP: #428588) and borderless printing.
  * debian/patches/kde4-kdesudo-support.dpatch: Try also
    /usr/lib/kde4/libexec/kdesu as sudo GUI (LP: #281880).
  * debian/hplip.install, debian/hplip-gui.install: Moved all hp-* utilities
    which do not work in text mode from hplip to hplip-gui (LP: #430539).
  * debian/control: Let hplip recommend hpijs instead of hplip-cups, as this
    is our preferred driver for now. Add to hplip-gui's dependencies
    kdebase-runtime as one of the alternatives to provide a sudo GUI utility
    (LP: #281880). Added versioned depends and conflicts on hplip to hp-gui,
    due to the moving of the GUI-only utilities to hplip-gui.
  * debian/patches/hp-setup-prompt-for-custom-PPD.dpatch: hp-setup did not
    prompt for a custom PPD if the description field of the default PPD is
    empty (LP: #432808).

    cupsctl with "-h /var/run/cups/cups.sock" to avoid querying remote

 -- Mark Purcell <msp@debian.org>  Tue, 13 May 2008 20:30:37 +1000

hplip (2.8.4-0ubuntu1) intrepid; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
     o Closes: #462163
     o dbus communication support. All interprocess communication now occurs
       using the dbus message bus. python-dbus version 0.80 or greater is
       required.
     o Elimination of all persistent startup daemons. hpssd has been
       replaced with hp-systray that loads as a user startup item in the
       system tray in each user's desktop environment. When no HPLIP
       tools are running (e.g., hp-toolbox), and the user closes or
       disables hp-systray, there will be no HPLIP processes running
       whatsoever. Consequently, there is no longer an /etc/init.d/hplip
       startup script, and no processes need be run at system startup
       time.
     o PC send fax requires dbus support and a running hp-systray to
       operate. Only Linux distributions that have python-dbus 0.80 or
       greater support PC send fax as of this release.
     o Added support for the following new printers: HP LaserJet M1120 MFP,
       M1120n MFP, OfficeJet J6400, Photosmart C4340, Photosmart Pro B8800.
  * debian/hplip.links: Added /usr/bin/hp-systray link.
  * debian/hplip-gui.install: Added /etc/xdg/autostart/hplip-systray.desktop.
  * debian/patches/systray_applet_really_in_tray.dpatch: The systray applet
    needs to be started in QT4 mode so that it really gets into the tray.
  * debian/patches/hp_photosmart_pro_b9100_support.dpatch: Corrections
    on the models.dat entry for the HP PhotoSmart Pro B9100, especially
    for the correct color calibration mode.
  * debian/patches/hp-sendfax_crash_on_cancel.dpatch: hp-sendfax crashed
    when a fax job fails or gets canceled via the cancel button on the
    printer.
  * debian/patches/90_pseudo_id_fax_2.dpatch, 
    debian/patches/91_dj895_powerup.dpatch,
    debian/patches/hp_clj_3600_best_color_mode.dpatch,
    debian/patches/hp_oj_h470_alignment.dpatch,
    debian/patches/hp-setup_crash.dpatch: Removed, merged upstream.
  * debian/patches/85_rebuild_python_ui.dpatch: Regenerated.
  * debian/control: Added dependency on python-dbus 0.80 or newer and on
    libdbus-1-dev.
  * debian/control: Switched dependencies from python-qt3 to
    python-qt4.

    into /usr/lib/hplip any more. There are REALLY plattform-independent.
  * debian/control, debian/rules, debian/hplip-data.install,
    debian/hplip-firmware.install: Created new package for the firmware files
    for the HP LaserJet 1018 and 1020.
  * debian/hplip.preinst: Shut down the daemons of the old 1.x.x generation
    HPLIP and kill hpiod if the shut down did not work.
  * debian/*.desktop: Show the icons in the menus of Ubuntu/Xubuntu/Edubuntu,

hplip (1.7.3-0ubuntu3) gutsy; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Remove version numbers from libsnmp-dev build
    dependency, so that package builds with arbitrary versions of
    libsnmp.

 -- Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>  Thu, 31 May 2007 15:30:55 +0100

hplip (1.7.3-0ubuntu2) gutsy; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Make the dependencies of the "hpijs" package also be
    satisfied by "ghostscript" instead of only "gs-...", due to "gs-gpl"
    having been renamed to "ghostscript" after the ESP/GPL Ghostscript
    merger.

hplip (1.7.3-0ubuntu1) feisty; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: LP#82546, LP#83936, LP#85805, LP#87695,
    LP#92237, LP#94013, LP#94015, LP#94823, LP#95489)
    * HPLIP 1.7.3
      + Added the <nopjl /> tag to hpijs-generator.in. This will remove
        the extra foomatic PJL options from most HP LaserJet PPD
        files. The extra foomatic PJL options caused some HPIJS PCL data
        issues. This fixes a "PCL XL error" on LJ1010/1012 that can
        occur on different PCs (closes: LP#92237).
      + Fixed defect (An error occurs when send a fax coverpage with "&"
        or "<" character in Regarding or Optional Message field.)

        1.2 only)
      + Removed the wait cursor during the password entry screen
        [reported by Johannes]
      + Added error messages and suppressed content in toolbox when
        device is not found or unsupported
      + A new configure option was added --enable-cups11-build, this
        option controls the hp/hpfax device discovery message when no
        devices are found. If needed, this option provides backward
        compatibility with CUPS 1.1.x applications.
        With --enable-cups11-build set the "no_device_found" message is
        displayed during device discovery by the "hp" backend.
        With --disable-cups11-build (default) set the backend prints a
        scheme based on the following conditions.
            Condition 1 - no daemons
              output nothing stdout return exit 1
            Condition 2 - daemons running, no HP devices, output scheme
              direct hp "Unknown" "HP Printer (HPLIP)" return exit 0
            Condition 3 - daemons running, HP printer found, output URI
              direct hp:/... "hp model" "HP model HPLIP" "deviceid"
            return exit 0

         2. Added libm library check to configure.in.
         3. Added some IPP "STATE:" messages for CUPS 1.2 in the "hp"
            backend.
       + Applied 'hplip-loop' patch from Tim Waugh [changes hpssd.py async
         loop timeout from 0.5 to 5.0 sec].
       + Fixed defect (The fax setup failed when executing hp-setup with
         serial number USB ID parameter in terminal in Fedora Core6 32bit
         OS.)
       + Fixed defect ([hp-setup] device i/o error no way to cancel or go
         back.)
       + Fixed defect (The edit function can not be executed when changing
         fax number only in Fax Address Book.)

         "Finished Adding printer" page.)
       + Fixed defect (Parameter "-bcups" of hp-probe command is disabled.)
       + Fixed a potential batch scanning memory leak in libsane-hpaio with
         scanimage version 1.0.18 or higher.
       + Fixed defect (A blank screen is displayed while executing
         "hp-check -lerror" in the terminal.)

         twice when executing a fax job with multi-pages in terminal in
         Fedora core6.)

         encountered in CUPS. [reported by user on mailing list]

         Make copies is temp. disabled for all inkjet AiOs]
       + Replaced "pragma pack(1)" with "__attribute__ ((packed))" in all
         C/C++ structures. This was needed for the ARM gcc compiler.
       + Removed the libusb little-endian conversion in hpiod. This
         conversion was not needed for big-endian systems because the usbfs
         takes care of the big-endian to little-endian conversion.
       + Added SANE_DEBUG_HPAIO support to libsane-hpaio
       + Finished enhancement (Add mDNS/Bonjour/Rendezvous support to

         applications, the preferred way to read the models.dat file is to
         use the hplip_api. The hplip_api can be used to get model attributes
         without running the HPLIP daemons.  See hplip_api.h for reference.
       + Fixed defect (These Examples in usage of hp-setup that would work
         in non-interactive mode should specify -i parameter.)
       + Fixed defect (hp-print UI not usable on 800x600 screen w/GNOME)
    * HPIJS 2.6.12:
      + Made hplip_api calls in hpijs conditional at compile time. The
        hpijs configure flag "hplip-build" will determine if hplip_api calls
        are used.
      + Added support for the following new printer(s).
        + Color LaserJet CP4005 (LJColor/PS)

hplip (1.6.10-3ubuntu3) feisty; urgency=low

  * Fixed hplip.desktop and added hplip-kubuntu.desktop.
    Kubuntu doesn't have any application categorised in "Settings"
    so that results a crappy Kmenu. The hplip.desktop file will not
    show in KDE, and the kubuntu one, only shows in KDE, in
    "System" section.

        button
      + Added "Setup New Device..." in Toolbox

        larger
      + Fixed defect: hp-setup -u par device detection problem
      + Fixed defect: the "Location" and "Description" for Fax Information

    install (borkage added by upstream on 1.6.9), thanks to Matthias Klose
    for forwading the bug report from Ubuntu
  * debian/rules: correct paths to platform.h and auto-include.h, thanks
    to Matthias Klose from Ubuntu
  * debian/rules, debian/control: do the proper thing for binNMU safety,
    and also simplify the various package relationships as much as we can:
    hpijs-ppds: now depend on hpijs (versioned >=).  hpijs: remove conflicts
    with non-compatible ppd packages, and version suggests on hpijs-ppds
    strictly.  hplip-dbg: depend strictly on the version of hplip and hpijs
    the debug symbols came from.  hplip: suggest hpijs and hpijs-ppds with
    >= version.  This does allow the user to do stupid things if he really
    wants, but given the ammount of arch any/all mixes in this set of
    packages, attempting to get it perfect only causes headaches while
    upgrading (and it is also nearly impossible)
  * hplip.init: tell user to reinstall hplip if the statoverrides are
    missing (closes: #393271)

      + Fixed gcc 4.1 compiler issues with HPIJS glue code
      + Added support for the following new printers:
        + Deskjet D4100 series (DJ4100)
        + Deskjet D2300 series (DJ3600)
        + Deskjet D1360 series (DJ3320)
        + Photosmart A430 series (DJGenericVIP)
        + Photosmart A510 series (DJGenericVIP)
        + Photosmart A710 series (PSP470)
        + Photosmart A610 series (PSP470)
        + Photosmart C4100 series (DJGenericVIP)
        + Photosmart C3100 series (DJGenericVIP)
        + Photosmart D7300 series (DJGenericVIP)
      + Updated the Ghostscript KRGB patch: Revisited the KRGB buffer
        overflow issue with out-of-band data in fill_rectangle and
        copy_mono.  Changed the fill_rectangle and copy_mono to an inner
        loop buffer check instead of a outer loop x/y extent check.
        As requested by Ralph Giles, added K 1-bit (KRGB) and 8-bit (KxRGB)
        support for KRGB, but only 1-bit is implemented for now
  * hpijs-ppds: depend on foomatic-filters as the PPDs require foomatic-rip
    to work.  Version dependency to a new enough foomatic-rip (available in
    stable as well, so this is not strictly needed, but still...)
    (closes: #369833)
  * hpijs: drop suggestion on foomatic-filters, hpijs doesn't use it for
    anything anyway, and the PPDs (who do) now depend on it
  * hplip: recommend one of hpijs-ppds or linuxprinting.org-ppds instead of
    suggesting both.  HPLIP really needs a PPD to do anything useful
  * Improve description of the hplip-dbg package a little
  * debian/watch: remove outdated URIs, update to version 3
  * dpatch 00_01_upstream-0.9.11-2 (remove): applied upstream
  * dpatch 00_01_upstream-1.6.6-1 (new): upstream HPLIP 1.6.6-1
  * dpatch 40_quiet-hpiod (remove): accepted upstream
  * dpatch 60_lp_instead_of_lpr: rediff
  * dpatches 50_ui-supportform-cleanups, 55_ui-supportform-debian (disable):
    upstream removed the supportform, but we may want to add those panes
    somewhere else so just disable the patches for now
  * dpatch 20_fix_warnings (new): fix broken code in hpijs that caused
    warnings
  * Remove old KRGB 1.2 patches

      + Changed hpssd so that it will not send an email if the same device
        has the same error code multiple times in a row
      + Changes auto device refresh interval units from seconds to minutes
        in the hp-toolbox
      + Added a device auto refresh type (all or 1) to settings dialog in
        the hp-toolbox
      + Replaced hplip_readme.html with web documents available at
        hplip.sf.net
      + Moved the DeviceClose in the hp-toolbox testpage routine to before
        the lpr to fix an issue with contention with the "hp" backend
      + Fixed a defect in hp-fab that didn't allow previously added
        entries to be modified

      + Changed hp-fab so that duplicate entries cannot be created
      + Fixed endianness issue that hosed the HP Color LaserJet 3500 on
        PPC (closes: #317683)
    * HPIJS 2.1.10:
      + Moved PSC 21xx from DJGenericVIP to DJ9xxVIP device class
        (this requires all PSC 21xx users to update their PPDs)
      + Forced hpijs and hppgsz to always build with -DNDEBUG
      + Merged hpijs_readme.html into hplip documentation
      + Added support for the following new printers:

    hplip-doc.  The hplip and hpijs packages now have just Debian
    documentation, and point to the hplip-doc package (or to the
    online URI for that documentation) for the full user manual

    to point users to the hplip-doc package and to the online manual

hplip (0.9.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    * HPLIP 0.9.10 (patchlevel 2):
      + Made the "hp" backend more product specific, now HP USB keyboards
        won't be misdetected as printers....
      + Fixed jetdirect write timeout in hpiod
      + Added deviceID to output of "hp" backend for CUPS 1.2
      + Fixed a problem where no fax send dialog pops up when sending
        a fax job from OpenOffice Writer and the fax job can not be sent
        correctly
      + Fixed a hp-setup crash which can occur during fax setup testpage
        printing
      + Modified the hp-toolbox and hp-print so that they will work with
        unsupported printer models without crashing
      + Hp-setup now allows the user to manually enter a PPD file path
      + The "NickName" from each located PPD file is displayed to the user
        so that the "(recommended)" text will be shown.
      + Fixed an error which occurs while executing hp-sendfax with
        b parameter.
      + Fixed a hp-toolbox problem displaying cartridge information for
        Photosmart 8700 when device is connected via network

hplip (0.9.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    * HPIJS 2.1.9:
      + Fixed an array index underflow in ljfastraster.cpp
      + Save paper width and height in UXServices object after a call to

        return actual paper dimensions for PrintableArea
      + Added support for the following new printer(s):
        + HP DeskJet F300 Series All-in-one (DJ3600)
    * HPLIP 0.9.9:
      + HPLIP now uses libusb for all USB I/O.  Libusb replaces kernel
        modules printer and usblp, and opens an entirely new can of worms
      + Removed support for USB URIs based on device files.  This means all
        printers now use USB URIs based on "hp:/hp_model?serial=xxxxxxxx"
        instead of "hp:/hp_model?device=/dev/usb/lpx".  Old CUPS queues must
        be updated to the new device location
      + Added full USB 1284.4 support for the Color LaserJet 2840, and for
        LaserJets 3050, 3060, 1010, 1012, 1015 and 2500

      + Updated most LaserJet PPDs for CUPS 1.2
      + Changed the GetSnmp timeout from 5 to 2 seconds in hpiod
      + Fixed incorrect supplies information for Color Laserjet 2840
        displayed in hp-toolbox
      + Fixed problem where title input was of no use while adding a file to
        item list in send fax dialog
      + Add models.xml parallel port flag for Deskjet 5550
      + Moved hp-sendfax temp .g3 files to ~/hpfax/hpfax-*.g3.  Before,
        they would clutter the user's home directory
      + Files added to hp-sendfax interface are now rendered into g3 format
        as they are added to the batch
      + Removed temporary file creation from hpfax: (temp files now created
        only by hp-sendfax using mkstemp)
      + Added total page counting feature to hp-sendfax
      + Added a BSD license to magic.py
  * debian/control: build-depend on libusb >= 0.1.8
  * dpatch 00_01_upstream-0.9.8-4: remove (applied upstream)
  * dpatch 60_lp_instead_of_lpr: rediff to remove skips
  * dpatch 40_quiet-hpiod: rediff to remove skips

  * dpatch 70_sane_ppd_directory_handling: remove (applied upstream)
  * dpatch 45_quiet_hpijs-fax: remove (applied upstream)
  * dpatch 35_no-fax-setuid: remove, upstream now does seteuid()/setegid()

  * dpatch 10_shebang_fixes (new): new dump place for #!<interpretor> fixing
  * hplip.menu: s/hp-fax/hp-sendfax/

  * debian/control, debian/rules: provide and use hpijs:Upstream-Version,
    rename Upstream-Version to hplip:Upstream-Version
  * Rename hplip-ppds package to hpijs-ppds, update all documentation to
    point to hpijs-ppds and linuxprinting.org-ppds and add a hpijs.NEWS
    entry about the package rename as well
  * debian/control: conflict hpijs with hplip-ppds versioned to source
    version, as a dirty trick to not clash with hpijs-ppds providing
    hplip-ppds
  * debian/rules, debian/hpijs-ppds.install, debian/hpijs-ppds.links,
    debian/hpijs-ppds.NEWS:
    Don't ship non-hpijs PPDs anymore, linuxprinting.org-ppds takes care
    of the pure postscript PPDs now
  * debian/rules: version hpijs-ppds the same way we version hpijs
  * debian/control: suggest hpijs-ppds and linuxprinting.org-ppds for hplip
    instead of recommending the old hplip-ppds package.  Recommend hpijs
    with fax support for hplip. Remove conflict on foomatic-db-hpijs and
    foomatic-filters-ppds from hplip.  Conflict hpijs-ppds with
    foomatic-filters-ppds before 20060113-1 when the PPD duplication was
    removed from foomatic-filters-ppds
  * debian/control: rework package descriptions a little
  * debian/rules: ship all PPD files compressed
  * debian/rules: separate arch-dep and arch-indep install, to avoid wasting
    a great deal of time on slower archs gziping PPDs
  * hplip initscript: Run hpiod as root because of libusb
  * debian/copyright: update dates

  * New upstream version
    * HPIJS 2.1.8 (patchlevel 4):

      + Updated KRGB patches to version 1.2:
        + Fixed krgb buffer overflow issue with out-of-band data in
          fill_rectangle and copy_mono. This buffer overflow condition
          occurred with fullbleed print jobs that had k-band images

          gs_free *str memory leak.

      + Enhanced the status history table in hp-info
      + Changed device list in toolbox to use small icons for status overlay
      + Modified models.xml file to add pen info back to OJ5500 and disable
        front panel
      + Removed probe.py from distribution
      + Added Fax URI generation to hp-makeuri
      + Fixed hp-makeuri so that it would not report URIs for non-existent
        functions
      + Fixed hp-makeuri quiet modes that they are actually quiet
      + Added a new chooser dialog that presents a list of CUPS queues
        rather than device URIs (hp-sendfax, hp-print)
      + Fixed a hpiod problem with the PS 2570 series. This will fix the
        scanning blue-screen error with USB High Speed
  * dpatch 00_01_upstream-0.9.8-4 (new): 0.9.8 patchlevel 4
  * hplip package: recommend python-reportlab for fax cover page support
  * Instead of modifying the PPD manufacturer tag from HP to HP (HPLIP),
    now append HPLIP and the upstream version to the nickname
    (closes: #347264)
  * Ship hpijs PPDs in /usr/share/ppd/hpijs/<PPD Manufacturer> as per
    the Debian PPD file structure specification.  Ship the pure postscript
    PPDs in /usr/share/ppd/hplip-postscript, for now
  * Normalise case and start all HP PPD file names with "HP-"
  * debian/control: Remove foomatic-db-hpijs from suggests and
    recommends, as it will go away

  * Mention that the RSS patch is stale in hpijs' README
  * Removed patch already applied upstream: 00_01_upstream_0.9.7-2
  * dpatches 30_no-ping, 50_doc-location, 60_lp_instead_of_lpr: rediff
  * Let configure detect all standard paths for CUPS, except for the
    PPD path
  * Prune non-shipped-files.txt, and change debian/rules to tell us
    which files were removed instead of doing it silently
  * dpatch 70_sane_ppd_directory_handling (new): modify hplip to
    look for PPD files under /usr/share/ppd/hplip, instead of
    searching the entire CUPS PPD tree (used by hp-setup)
  * Add menu entries for hp-print, hp-sendfax and hp-fab
  * Add HPmenu.xpm icon
  * dpatch 35_no-fax-setuid (new): change hpssd fax queue function
    not to setuid(), as we don't run as root.  This limits sending
    faxes somehow, but the impact is not clear to me yet.  Bug reports
    welcome
  * dpatch 45_quiet_hpijs-fax (new): remove noisy hpijs debug output in
    the fax driver
  * debian/control: rework package descriptions, mention fax support

  * Keep the .desktop file, add "NoDisplay=true".
  * Keep qt build dependencies, now in main.
  * hplip-data now provides hpijs-data (introduced in 0.9.8).
  * Try to open a message dialog for the "No Qt" message. Malone: #26413.
  * Install ppd files into a manufacturer specific directory.
  * Set the manufacturer name to "HP".
  * Start hplip before cupsys. Malone: #3841, #26570.

    + SuperB margin issue with OJ K550, OJ K850 and DJ9800
    + _GNU_SOURCE define in hpaio.h. (from RedHat)
  * Remove versioning of python-qt3 and pyqt-utils build-dependencies to
    make backports easier.  Current versions in stable, testing and sid
    are safe AFAIK
  * Build-depend on libsnmp9-dev|libsnmp5-dev, to ease sarge backports

 -- Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Dec 2005 14:05:12 -0200

hplip (0.9.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switch from two versioned conflicts to two versioned depends/recommends
    to encode the relationship between hplip and hplip-data.  This is

      + Changed hp-toolbox startup behavior to increase performance
      + Added checks in messaging code to prevent invalid messages from
        crashing hpssd
      + Added hp-toolbox PML cleanup code to LJ status code
      + Fixed clj28xx scanning issue. Mfpdtf buffer was too small
        libsane-hpaio. This fixes a problem introduced in 0.9.5
      + Modified hp-makeuri to allow hostnames for network addresses
      + Added support for "alternate n-up" for PS documents to hp-print
      + Fixed an issue where the website link for support information is
        wrong in "HP" tab of "Support Information" dialog

      + Fixed an issue where an error occurs while executing the command
        "hp-check -lnone" in terminal

        show a correct prompt when running the command "hp-align" with parameter
        -p
      + Fixed System::GetSnmp sigfault in hpiod. This will fix network
        scanning/hp-toolbox issues in previous HPLIP releases
      + Fixed an issue where an error occurs while executing hp-photo after
        the usb cable was disconnected
  * Use far less tight versioning that works with the new rules for binNMUs,
    and break a dependency loop while at it (closes: #339909)
  * Add versioned dependency on coreutils 5.1+ (closes: #337375)
  * New dpatch 60_lp_instead_of_lpr:
    Use "lp" instead of "lpr" to submit jobs (closes: #336407)
  * Ship copyright and changelogs along with hplip-data too, as it is not
    depending on hplip anymore and the /usr/share/doc/hplip-data symlink has
    to go away

hplip (0.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    * HPIJS 2.1.6:
      + Moved DJ450 from DJGenericVIP class to DJ9xxVIP class, because
        mandatory margins are 0.25 inch on left and right sides and it does
        not support fullbleed on any papersize
      + Added a new printer family, DJ55xx to take care of margin issues for
        DJ55xx printers
      + Fixed a bug in sending custom paper size to JetReady and FastRaster
        printers
      + Fixed a bug in LJFastRaster when last band was less than 128 height,
        it was incorrectly positioned.
      + Fixed margin adjustment code to allow fullbleed or .125 inch margins
        for those printers that support it in autoduplex mode
      + Added support for the following new printers:
        + HP Color LaserJet 4730 MFP (LJColor/PS)
        + HP Deskjet 460 (DJGenericVIP)
        + HP Officejet Pro K550, K850 (DJGenericVIP)
    * HPLIP 0.9.6:
      + In hp-toolbox (Device Manager) made a small LaserJet status change
        that makes the CLJ 2550 work correctly
      + Fixed a bug with the PSC3310 with low photo supplies (caused a
        toolbox exception)
      + Fixed a problem that made an offline CLJ2500 crash hpssd
      + The hp-toolbox no longer uses a "listen" server socket.  All
        communication is done over the same client socket to hpssd
      + Added new hp-toolbox UI for supplies and maintenance tools
      + Made numerous changes to hp-toolbox
      + Set CLJ 25xx devices to uni-di mode in models.xml
  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:
    * Remove patches already applied upstream:
      00_upstream-0.9.5-3, 11_fix-misc-gcc-warnings, 13_intsign-fixes,
      15_64bit_fixes, 20_fix_unitialized_var_bugs, 50_hp-clean_fix,
      99_ubuntu_hplip-deroot
    * Remove some hunks already applied upstream:
      14_charsign_fixes
    * Add a NEWS file for hpijs, warning users of PPDs that are documented
      by upstream to have been changed significantly
    * Fix hpijs autobuild system to actually work re. libhpip, by adding
      some automake magic and libtool support
    * Merge hplip-base and hplip packages.  Current upstream code makes it
      a losing battle to try to keep the two separate
    * Don't bother explaining about alternate PPD sources in basic docs like
      README.Debian.  Don't suggest them in control file, either.  This is
      needed because HPLIP PPDs often change in non-forward or non-backwards
      compatible ways
    * Remove stray scan/__init__.py file
    * New patch 30_noping: Do not attempt to send icmp packets in hpssd, as
      it will not work since it doesn't run as root anymore.  Thanks to
      tatu.mannisto@iki.fi for the report (closes: #333850)
    * New patch 40_quiet-hpiod: Shut hpiod up while trying to autodetect
      parallel port printers, it was being waay too annoying in syslog
    * New patch 50_doc-location: Add final / to URIs and point the readme
      to the /usr/share/doc location inside hp-toolbox.  If the local admin
      doesn't like documentation and removes /usr/share/doc/hplip, this
      doesn't break anything... you just get no documentation, which was
      kind the point the admin was trying to make, I suppose ;-)

    * Move hp-print from hplip-base to hplip, as it has a GUI now, thanks

  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:
    * Swap maintainer and uploader fields for now, since I am spending
      far more time in HPLIP than Torsten.  Should that change, he will
      switch the fields back as they were
    * Tell libtool that the sane plugin is a plugin with -module
    * Split hplip into GUI and non-GUI packages, as suggested by
      Matthias Klose <doko@ubuntu.com> (closes: #307790)
      + Change /usr/share/doc/hplip to a symlink (requires hplip.preinst
        and hplip.postinst glue to support error unwind and downgrades)
      + Change hplip package to arch all, as all C source and binary
        modules belong in hplip-base
      + hplip-base.preinst (new), hplip-base.postrm (new), hplip.postrm:
        Remove any .pyc and .pyo files scattered around /usr/lib/hplip
    * Fix configure.in, Makefile.am to accept and use a PYTHON variable
      to select the python version to run properly, and really use whatever
      python that variable points to, and no other (closes: #307788)
    * Rework configure.in and Makefile.am a bit, in a moment of utter
      boredom
    * Change autogen.sh and debian/rules to get the hpijs versioning
      through autoconf --trace at autotools-run time, and document the
      debian/hpijs.version file in debian/README.Source
    * Remove unneeded #! lines from python modules before packaging the
      debs, to make lintian happier
    * Control new files showing up upstream, by using a static list of
      non-shipped files and passing --fail-missing to dh_install
    * Remove debian/executable.files and debian/deletable.files support,
      as this package does not require it
    * hplip-base: recommend cupsys-client, as some of the utilities
      run "lp -d..." and friends (closes: #308960)
    * Rediff 01_rss.dpatch, 10_missing-prototypes.dpatch,
      11_fix-misc-gcc-warnings.dpatch, 13_intsign-fixes.dpatch,
      40_testmail_fix.dpatch, 50_hp-clean_fix.dpatch to remove some hunks
      accepted upstream and remove any fuzziness and line numbering skews
    * Remove patch 30_bind_to_INADDR_LOOPBACK, completely accepted
      upstream

hplip (0.8.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:
    * HPLIP:
      * SECURITY FIX: create .hplip.conf on user directory mode 600 (was 666)
        The HPLIP suite was failing to set the process umask to sane values,
        hpssd.py and hpguid.py were affected.  Also, modify HPLIP so that it
        warns the user of the broken permissions, ignores such a file, and 
        fixes the permissions on the next time the config file is written to.
        Thanks to Erwan David <erwan@rail.eu.org> for reporting this bug
        (closes: #293117)

  * New upstream source
    + Fixed a issue with the max setting for input trays in APDK (HPIJS 2.0.1)

  * Henrique de Moraes Holschuh:
    * Better dpatch support on debian/rules: use clean-patched target
      instead of reinvoking make
    * Patches 22_hpssd_pidfile and 50_bigendian merged upstream
    * Rediff all dpatches and switch to -p1, so that using dpatch-edit-patch
      is much easier
    * HPLIP:
      * Try to stop all instances of hpguid.py on initscript stop.  We need
        to revisit this later when hpguid and hpssd get more intelligent
        hpguid pidfile/termination handling

        trays (ie: laserjets): Envelopes #10, A2, C6, DL, Japanese #3,
        Japanese #4
      + Added KRGB colorspace support (patch to ghostscript required to
        enable)
    * Update dependencies to use gs-gpl, add gs-afpl as lowest priority
    * Update standards version to 3.6.1
    * Add copyright notice for the Debian packaging to debian/copyright
    * Use debhelper compatibility mode V4
    * Switch to packaged dpatch
    * Remove auto-generated files auto-include.h and platform.h in clean
      target
    * Autotools-dev support, using links
    * Enable AM_MAINTAINER_MODE
    * Set things up so that we regen the entire autotools toolchain (by
      calling autogen.sh) on cvs-checkout.  Add an autogen.sh, since
      upstream lacks one
    * Modify configure.in so that our CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS are respected
    * Add a simple manpage for the hpijs binary with pointers to the real
      docs, since hpijs is NEVER called directly
